Nodes encode formalization-specific rest problems, but the search is conducted to identify an object of some object space S.
Such an object should, by definition, always be creatable from a path to a goal node in the traversal tree.

		<td>This is the dimension of the TRAVERSAL tree, which may be infinite even if the searched graph itself is finite. <b>Note:</b> This seems odd, because the finiteness depends on how we conduct the search (parent discarding on or off).</td>
		<td>Can the solution property be checked <emph>only</emph> considering the last node (instead of considering the entire path)? Intuitively, does the way <emph>how</emph> one reaches a node in the original graph affect the question whether the path is a solution? If not, then any path to such a node is a solution, and then the solution property can be checked locally for the node.</td>
		<td>Can the solution object be created <emph>only</emph> from the last node (instead of considering the entire path)?</td>
		<td>Do we need labels for the edges to describe the transition?</td>
