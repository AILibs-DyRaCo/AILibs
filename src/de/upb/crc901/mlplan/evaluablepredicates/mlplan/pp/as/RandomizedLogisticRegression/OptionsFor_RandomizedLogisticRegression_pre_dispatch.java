    /*
        pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'
