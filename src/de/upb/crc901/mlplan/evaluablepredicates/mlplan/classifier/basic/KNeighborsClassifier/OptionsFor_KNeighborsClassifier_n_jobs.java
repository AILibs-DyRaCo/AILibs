/*
    n_jobs : int, optional (default = 1)
    The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
    If ``-1``, then the number of jobs is set to the number of CPU cores.
    Doesn't affect :meth:`fit` method.

Examples
--------
>>> X = [[0], [1], [2], [3]]
>>> y = [0, 0, 1, 1]
>>> from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
>>> neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
>>> neigh.fit(X, y) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
KNeighborsClassifier(...)
>>> print(neigh.predict([[1.1]]))
[0]
>>> print(neigh.predict_proba([[0.9]]))
[[ 0.66666667  0.33333333]]

Notes
-----
See :ref:`Nearest Neighbors <neighbors>` in the online documentation
for a discussion of the choice of ``algorithm`` and ``leaf_size``.

.. warning::

   Regarding the Nearest Neighbors algorithms, if it is found that two
   neighbors, neighbor `k+1` and `k`, have identical distances
   but different labels, the results will depend on the ordering of the
   training data.
